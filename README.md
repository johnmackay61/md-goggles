# MD-Goggles
#### Simple Markdown Viewer
## Overview
MD-Goggles functions as a stand-alone markdown parser in a similar vein to the now discontinued [MDWiki](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki) of [Dynalon](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki). The intention is to implement MD-Goggles as a Bootstrap 5 compliant single page markdown file parser without jQuery in a smaller footprint.
