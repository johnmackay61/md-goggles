# MD-Goggles
#### Simple Markdown Viewer
## Overview
MD-Goggles is intended to function as a markdown viewer that functions in a similar vein to Dynalon's discontinued MDWiki project. The intention is to implement MD-Goggles as a Bootstrap 5 compliant single page markdown file parser without jQuery in a smaller footprint.
